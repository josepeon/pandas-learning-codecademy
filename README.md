# Pandas Learning (Codecademy)

This repo contains my notes and code from the Codecademy *Pandas Foundations for AI Engineers* course.

It is structured as a single Python file: `Pandas Learning.py`, where I test and build everything step-by-step.

Most of the initial code in this file was written with the help of GitHub Copilot as reference examples to understand key Pandas operations and syntax.

## Structure

- `Pandas Learning.py` – Main script with all lessons and examples
- `data/` – Datasets used during learning
